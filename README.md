<h3 align="center">One point of contact. A crew that does the work.</h3>

XO is the Executive Officer, second in command, who runs the crew and carries out the commander's intent without assuming the commander's authority.

This fork ships an executive-officer voice - ACP 125 radiotelephone prowords, with answers shaped by [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) section 9 to be acted on rather than merely read - and adds [Plane mission intake](docs/plane-missions.md) for teams using repo-local Pocock engineering skills.
Plane tickets remain the shared backlog and GitHub PRs carry implementation; the XO reads and writes those tickets through the Plane connector its session already has, so nothing here stores tracker credentials.
Use `/sitrep` for status, `/debrief` for learnings, `/offgrid` for away supervision and `/refresh` for updates.
The upstream architecture below remains the runtime foundation.


## What it is

You can run one coding agent easily.
But the moment you want three project tasks done in parallel - fixes, investigations, plans, audits - you become a tab-juggler: babysitting sessions, copy-pasting context between repos, forgetting which terminal had the failing test.

XO flips the model.
You talk to a single agent - the XO - and it runs the crew for you: spawning autonomous agents in a visible session backend, giving each a clean git worktree, supervising them to completion, and handing you finished PRs, approved local merges, or standalone investigation reports.
For larger fleets, you can opt in to persistent secondmates: second mates that are still ordinary direct reports, but run from their own isolated XO homes on this machine or another SSH-reachable host.

XO is not a model, not a harness, not a skill, not an MCP server, and not a CLI.
XO is an agent distro for running a crew of agents.
An agent distro is a portable directory of instructions, skills, tooling, policies, and state conventions that turns a general-purpose agent into a specialized one.
There is no app to install: the cloned repo is the distro - `AGENTS.md`, bundled XO skills, and helper scripts that any terminal coding agent can follow.
Launching a supported harness inside it for your primary session instantiates your XO - and makes you the captain.

## Features

- **One liaison** - you talk only to the XO; it dispatches, supervises, escalates only real decisions, and reports plain outcomes.
- **A visible crew** - every crewmate works in its own tmux window, Herdr tab, or experimental zellij tab, cmux workspace, or Orca terminal you can watch or type into; the XO reconciles.
- **Disposable worktrees** - each task runs in a clean [treehouse](https://github.com/kunchenguid/treehouse) git worktree, or an Orca-managed worktree when `backend=orca`, so parallel work on one repo never collides.
- **Two task shapes** - ship tasks deliver authorized changes; scout tasks leave standalone investigation reports when the intake contract warrants separate research.
- **Explicit project modes** - each project ships via `no-mistakes`, `direct-PR`, or `local-only`, with an optional `+yolo` merge-autonomy flag.
- **Optional secondmates** - opt in to persistent second mates that run from isolated XO homes with their own `XO_HOME`, state, projects, and session lock, either locally or as a whole home on an SSH-reachable host, with guarded updates and recovery that never turns an unavailable remote route into a local replacement.
- **Event-driven, zero-token supervision** - a bash watcher sleeps on the fleet and wakes the XO only when something needs you; verified primary harnesses also get a turn-end backstop that blocks or follows up on a blind stop when work is under way and supervision is not live.
- **Optional Relay** - opt in with one local `.env` pairing token so XO can answer your public mentions on X and Discord alike, act on normal reversible mention requests through the same lifecycle as chat requests, acknowledge spawned work, and post up to three public-safe completion follow-ups within seven days for genuine milestones and the final outcome without changing non-Relay behavior; a final reply promised in a thread becomes durable state that is reconciled from disk, so a restart or a compacted conversation cannot lose it; dry-run preview records would-be replies and dismissals locally before go-live.
- **Strict project boundary** - the XO is read-only over your projects except for the narrow guarded and captain-approved operations authorized by [hard rule 1](AGENTS.md#1-identity-and-prime-directives), including fleet sync's guarded safe branch pruning; crewmates make every other project change behind the configured merge authority.
- **Restart-proof** - all state lives on disk and in the active session backend (tmux by hard default, herdr or cmux when selected or auto-detected, zellij/orca when explicitly selected); kill the session anytime and the next one reconciles, including confirmed-dead secondmate agents, and carries on.

Full detail on every feature lives in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- A verified primary agent harness: Claude Code, Grok, Pi, `pi-signed`, Oh My Pi (`omp`), Codex, OpenCode, or Cursor Agent CLI.
- Git and the GitHub CLI, authenticated through `gh auth login`.
- The CLI and dependencies for your selected runtime backend; tmux is the reference default.

The XO detects and offers to install supported missing tools after you approve.
Backend-specific setup is linked in [Documentation](#documentation).

### Recommended harnesses

**Claude Code, Grok, and Pi are equal co-primary recommendations** for running the primary XO session, with `pi-signed` supported as Pi's distinct signed-wrapper identity.
Claude Code uses a tracked Stop hook for tokenless watcher re-arm and rewake, Grok uses background-notify wake cycles, and Pi uses its tracked primary watcher extension.
All three have verified turn-end guard paths when launched with their documented setup.
Pick whichever one matches your subscription and workflow.

Oh My Pi (`omp`), a Pi fork, is verified as a primary with the same extension-owned watcher model as Pi and a stronger turn-end guard: its blocking `session_stop` hook compels a continuation instead of requesting one.
Codex and OpenCode are also verified and supported as primary harnesses; Codex uses bounded foreground checkpoints, and OpenCode uses a TUI plugin, so both carry more harness-specific supervision tradeoffs than the three co-primaries.
Cursor Agent CLI is verified as a primary too, using a tracked project-scope `.cursor/hooks.json` whose `stop` hook parks on the watcher between turns, closest in shape to Claude Code's.
Launch it with `--trust`, or none of its project hooks load; it also has no turn-end hook in headless `cursor-agent -p`, so run the primary session interactively.

### Install and launch

```sh
gh auth login
git clone https://github.com/inocult/xo
cd xo
```

Then launch one of the co-primary harnesses; AGENTS.md takes over from there:

**Claude Code**

```sh
claude
```

**Grok**

```sh
grok --trust
```

**Pi**

```sh
pi
# or, when the signed wrapper is installed
XO_PI_HARNESS=pi-signed pi-signed
```

**Oh My Pi**

```sh
omp
# or, when starting from inside a Claude Code pane
XO_OMP_HARNESS=omp omp
```

Start `omp` with this checkout as its working directory: it auto-discovers the tracked `.omp/extensions/*.ts` files with no trust dialog, and naming them with `-e` as well would load each twice.

For Grok, `--trust` is needed once per clone so project hooks and the turn-end guard load; `/hooks-trust` inside Grok works too.
For Pi, approve the project trust prompt once per clone on first launch so the tracked `.pi/extensions/*.ts` files auto-load.
Pi's `/calm` toggle hides supported transcript chrome, including canonically classified XO operational user rows, and uses a Calm-only animated working boat during active runs while preserving all model context and session data.
Those Calm-hidden operational inputs remain ordinary user-role messages with unchanged delivery, ordering, authority, persistence, and exports.
The preference persists for the effective XO home, and toggling it off restores ordinary rendering.
[Calm's current behavior and supported limits](docs/calm.md) are separate from its [version-scoped maintainer evidence](docs/calm-mode-feasibility.md).
Pi's `/supervision-model` command pins a cheaper model and a shallower reasoning effort for the supervision branch alone, from the eligible models and thinking levels Pi itself reports, and with no pin the branch normally follows your own conversation's model and effort; see the [configuration schema](docs/configuration.md#pi-supervision-branch-model-and-effort-configsupervision-branch-model-configsupervision-branch-effort).

### Talk to it

```sh
> ahoy! look at my github project xyz, then fix the flaky login test and add dark mode

# xo checks its toolchain (asking your consent before installing anything),
# clones the project under projects/ and spawns two isolated workers in the active backend.
# Minutes later:

  PR ready for review, captain: https://github.com/you/xyz/pull/42
  (fix flaky login test - risk: low - CI green)

> alright merge it
```

### More backends

Setup guides for tmux (the default) and every other supported backend (herdr, zellij, Orca, cmux) are linked in [Documentation](#documentation) below.

## How It Works

```
            you (the captain)

     │
     ├─ ship: project mode ► PR/local merge ► teardown
     │
     └─ scout: report at data/<id>/report.md ► decision inventory ► relay findings ► teardown
```

You chat with the XO.
It routes each request to a crewmate in its own session endpoint and git worktree, supervises the fleet with a zero-token event-driven watcher, and brings you finished PRs, approved local merges, or investigation reports.
Optional secondmates extend this to persistent local or whole-home remote second mates, dispatch profiles let you steer which harness handles which task, and opt-in Relay lets the same fleet answer public mentions.
`codex-app` is not a runtime backend yet; [docs/codex-app-backend.md](docs/codex-app-backend.md) owns the Codex App boundary.

Full architecture - the supervision engine, worktree isolation, secondmates, dispatch profiles, project modes, optional Relay, fleet sync, and self-update - is in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Built-in skills

XO ships these user-invocable built-in skills.
Claude and grok use the slash form shown here; codex uses the same names with `$`, such as `$afk`.

| Skill              | What it does                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/operation`       | Plan work too big for one session as a shared map of decision tickets on your issue tracker, then resolve them one at a time until the way to the destination is clear |
| `/prep`            | Prepare this home and a repository for Plane missions: XO confirms the session's Plane connector, writes the home's private note of which workspace and project it works in and, only on your explicit confirmation of the exact list, creates any canonical triage label your shared Plane project is missing; a dispatched worker lands the project's domain-doc and tracker layout |
| `/overwatch on/off/status` | Enable, pause or inspect bounded automatic pickup of ready-for-agent Plane tickets |
| `/breach PLAT-27` | Dispatch one ticket through the Pocock-adapted implementation workflow |
| `/afk`             | Enter away-mode supervision: the sub-supervisor self-handles routine notifications in bash, escalates captain-relevant events and bounded declared-external-wait rechecks as batched digests, and actively alerts if delivery gets stuck while you step away |
| `/ahoy`            | Recap visible session events since the prior real captain message plus visibly unanswered captain decisions, then guide the captain through any open decisions one at a time in agent-judged impact order; fall back to Bearings when invoked as the session's first real captain message |
| `/bearings`        | Generate a concise four-section chat digest from bounded fleet state, including registered remote-home ledgers; use `/bearings file` to also replace today's dated report in `data/`, and add `include PRs` for live GitHub enrichment |
| `/estate <org>`    | Review an estate read-only - a GitHub organization or one `owner/repo` - and report who did what, velocity with a direction, quality signals with their limits, and where risk is concentrated; every run emits the same nine sections in the same order, and `/estate file` also writes the dated report under `data/` |
| `/updatexo` | Fast-forward the running XO and its secondmates, then persist and restart every live mate successfully left on the target commit - including already-current homes - with an honest re-read nudge only when restart cannot be proven |
| `/stow`            | Sweep the session for uncaptured durable knowledge, persist the open work records this session knows are unfiled or now wrong, curate tiered startup memory with decay and cold archival, enforce each home's budget or surface the required decision, cascade to registered second mates, and report what is safe to reset |

Estate review invocation examples:

- `/estate acme` reviews every repository the `acme` organization owns over the last 90 days.
- `/estate acme/widgets` reviews one repository with the same report shape.
- `/estate acme file` also writes `data/estate-review-acme-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.

The period is the only thing a run chooses.
Every other setting - the trend periods, the stalled and unmaintained thresholds, the repository and pull-request caps, and the fork and archived selection - is fixed and stated in the report itself, so two reports cannot differ for a reason their reader cannot see.

Bearings invocation examples:

- `/bearings` returns the fresh four-section digest in chat only.
- `/bearings include PRs` keeps chat-only mode and opts into live PR enrichment.
- `/bearings file` replaces today's `data/status-report-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` from scratch and links it from the four-section chat digest.
- `/bearings file include PRs` combines the dated report with live PR enrichment.

Agent-only reference skills live in the same `skills/` tree and are loaded by XO at the trigger points named in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

### Skills tree

Every bundled skill lives at `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md`, laid out like an installer-facing skills repository so you can install one skill without taking the whole distribution.
The category is derived from each skill's frontmatter, stability first: `deprecated` is redirect stubs and retired aliases, `in-progress` is skills that are new or backend- or integration-specific, `fieldcraft` is the portable skills without the internal marker that you can install into a project and call there, `orders` is the slash commands only the commander issues, `playbooks` is the procedures the XO loads at its triggers, and `misc` is only for anything that fits none of those.
`.agents/skills/<name>` is a relative symlink into that tree for each skill this home actually loads, so activation is expressed by which links exist, and `.claude/skills` points at `.agents/skills`.
Audience is expressed by the `metadata.internal` marker rather than by location, and a skill name may exist in more than one category only as two audience variants that differ by design, with the activation link choosing which one this home loads.
Skills that assume a live XO home carry `metadata.internal: true` in their frontmatter, which hides them from installer discovery (tools like the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) `npx skills add` installer) without affecting how XO itself loads them.
[`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md#operational-home-layout-and-state) owns the layout and category scheme.
